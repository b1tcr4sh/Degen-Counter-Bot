# Degenerate Word Counter Discord Bot

A simple, customizeable Discord bot which tracks the useage of a customizeable list of words.  This project is mostly just done as a meme, and like every project I do, became increasingly overscoped, but I'm still working on it anyway, so feel free to use it in your server, as a meme or for and practical purpose you can think, if you'd like.


## TODO:
- Integrate MongoDB to separate word counts between servers.
- Add total count global word count to activity status.
- Create categories of words which count individually, and have their own defineable word lists.
